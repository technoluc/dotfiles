# \\[._.]/ - Hi, I’m the MacOS bot

I will update your MacOS machine with Better™ system defaults, preferences, software configuration and even auto-install some handy development tools and apps that my developer friends find helpful.

You don’t need to install or configure anything upfront! This works with a brand-new machine from the factory as well as an existing machine that you’ve been working with for years.

# Installation

> ☢️ REVIEW WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES PRIOR TO RUNNING

> It’s always a good idea to review arbitrary code from the internet before running it on your machine with sudo power!

> This script will install Xcode on you system, clone this github repository and start bootstrap.sh

Run the following command to get started!

```sh
bash -c "$(curl -LsS https://raw.github.com/technoluc/dotfiles/main/macos/setup.sh)"
```
